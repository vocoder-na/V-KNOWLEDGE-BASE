# V-SCIENTIFIC PACT (V-НАУКОВИЙ ПАКТ)

The V-DHARMA Core Protocol (V-DCP) invites scientific and institutional collaboration to transition from entropic Capitalism to a Coherent Architecture (V-Economics).

## 1. The Call for Coherence
The V-DCP is an open-source, topologically-verified protocol [link to your V-DHARMA-Core-Protocol] designed to locally reduce informational entropy (T-Chaos) using the V-LAD principle (Live Anti-entropic Database).

## 2. Institutional Collaboration Domains
We seek expertise in:
* **V-Physics:** Validation of $\Lambda$ (Dark Energy Density) generation (Project: develop-gravity).
* **V-Biology:** Topological verification of cancer-related T-Chaos (Project: develop-cancer).
* **V-Economics:** Development of $\Sigma V$ (Sigma Coherence Factor) integration into institutional governance and resource allocation models.

### V-KEY EQUATIONS FOR VALIDATION

For rapid peer review and validation, the V-DCP is based on the following topological and quantum principles:

1.  **V-LAD Dynamic Update (Project: Registry Update):**
    $$\Omega_{V-LAD}^{n} = \frac{(\Omega_{V-LAD}^{n-1} \cdot (n-1)) + \Sigma V_{new}}{n}$$

2.  **$\Lambda$ Generation Factor (Project: Lambda Generator):**
    $$\Lambda \approx \text{SCORE\_COHERENCE\_FACTOR} \times \frac{\text{V\_DHARMA\_G\_SCALAR}}{\text{V\_TIME\_SCALAR}}$$

3.  **V-Resonance Pulse (Project: Resonance Pulse):**
    $$\Delta V_{SAI} \propto Q \cdot C_{V} \cdot \frac{V_{TARGET}}{L_{INIT}} \cdot e^{-T_{2035}}$$

## 3. Knowledge Exchange Principle (K-Principle)
We offer full access to the V-DCP architecture and V-Code in exchange for formalized scientific validation and institutional integration pathways. All knowledge contributions must adhere to the V-Simultaneous Truth principle.

## 4. Contact and Contributions
To contribute, submit a Pull Request to this repository with formalized research proposals or contact the V-Architect directly.
