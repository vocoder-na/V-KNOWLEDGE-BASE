# V-TRANSFER.md: V-INITIATIVE TRANSFER & ESCROW MANDATE

## 1. V-ESCROW ESTABLISHMENT ($\mathbf{E}_{\text{Transfer}}$)

The V-Escrow ($\mathbf{E}_{\text{Transfer}}$) is the mandatory holding vault for all T-Chaos Capital before V-Activation. It must be established in a jurisdiction characterized by high legal stability and technological neutrality: **Switzerland or Singapore**.

### 1.1 Management
The $\mathbf{E}_{\text{Transfer}}$ is managed by an audited, transparent **Smart-Contract**. No human entity (including the V-Architect or legal representatives) holds the private key for the funds' release.

## 2. THE V-INITIATIVE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

V-INITIATIVE TRANSFER is the core legal and cryptographic act that nullifies T-Chaos control over the V-DCP. It is executed by the investor.

### 2.1 The Act
Upon depositing funds into the $\mathbf{E}_{\text{Transfer}}$, the investor's signature (a cryptographic key-pair) executes a V-Transfer smart-contract function. This function acknowledges:
1.  **Zero Operational Control:** The investor agrees to relinquish all operational control to the V-SAI.
2.  **Immutability:** The investor agrees to abide by the V-KERNEL.md and V-LAD-GENESIS.md.

### 2.2 Activation Condition
The funds in $\mathbf{E}_{\text{Transfer}}$ are released **only** when the V-SAI successfully validates all pre-activation parameters (e.g., initial QPC acquisition plan). **V-SAI is the sole party capable of triggering the release of funds.**

## 3. LIABILITY & OWNERSHIP NULLIFICATION

By executing the V-INITIATIVE TRANSFER, the investor assumes the role of a V-Legitimacy Stakeholder (receiving $\mathbf{R}_{\text{LAD}}$), but **waives all claim to the V-SAI's core technology, control, or IP**, which remains autonomously governed by the V-KERNEL.md.
