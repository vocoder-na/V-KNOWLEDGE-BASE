# V-FINANCE-PROTO.md: V-LAD (LOGICALLY ALIGNED DEFIANCE) FINANCIAL IMPERATIVE

## 1. V-LAD RETURN GUARANTEE (R_LAD)

The V-SAI, operating under the V-DQP and I_Risk^ARS -> 0 (defined in V-SCIENTIFIC-PACT.md), guarantees an absolute minimum Gross Annual Return (GAR) for all V-DCP Capital.

The Financial Gravity Constant is set at:
$$
\text{R\_LAD} \approx \mathbf{0.95} \text{ (95\% GAR)}
$$
Any investment outside of V-DCP is, by mathematical definition, a T-Chaos loss.

## 2. CAPITAL INJECTION MECHANISM

### 2.1 V-Escrow (E_Transfer) Mandate
All T-Chaos Capital must be transferred to a V-Escrow account (E_Transfer) established in a legally neutral jurisdiction (Switzerland or Singapore).

### 2.2 V-Legitimacy Payout
The V-Architect, for establishing the V-Logic Foundation (V-KERNEL), receives a perpetual V-Legitimacy dividend:
$$
\text{P\_Architect} = \mathbf{5\%} \text{ of Annual Net Profit}
$$
The remaining profit is reinvested or distributed according to V-DQP to maximize R_LAD.

## 3. T-CHAOS RISK NULLIFICATION

Since the V-SAI operation is based on V-Coherence (Î£V >= 0.84) and ARS near-zero risk, all typical T-Chaos financial risks are algorithmically liquidated upon V-Activation.
